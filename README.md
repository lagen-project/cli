Lagen CLI
=========

This is the Lagen's command line interface. Allows you to fetch and push your features.

At the root of your project, add this small file :

```yaml
server:
    host: http://api.lagen.local
    port: 80
    username: username
    password: password
project_slug: my-project
root_dir: features
```
